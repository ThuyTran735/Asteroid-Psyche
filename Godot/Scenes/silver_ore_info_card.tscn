text = "Silver is commonly found in its native form or as a byproduct of mining other metals like gold and copper, with top producers being Mexico, Peru, China, Russia, and Poland. It is extracted using open-pit and underground mining methods and processed through crushing, grinding, flotation, cyanidation, and smelting. Silver is used in electronics, jewelry, photography, and as an investment due to its conductivity, reflectivity, and antimicrobial properties. While silver mining can cause environmental issues, sustainable practices are increasingly followed. Silver is highly recyclable, reducing the need for new mining. Historically, silver has been valued for currency, ornamentation, and trade, playing a crucial role in ancient economies."
