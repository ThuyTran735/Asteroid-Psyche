text = "Copper, symbolized by Cu and with an atomic number of 29, is a highly conductive metal used extensively in electrical wiring and electronics. Found naturally in both pure form and ores, it is prized for its malleability, ductility, and resistance to corrosion, which leads to the formation of a protective patina. With a history spanning over 10,000 years, copper has played a crucial role in early technologies and remains essential in modern applications. It is also biologically significant, supporting human health as a trace element, and its high recyclability makes it an environmentally friendly choice."
